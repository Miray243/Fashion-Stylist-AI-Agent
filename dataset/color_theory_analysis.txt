# ADVANCED COLOR THEORY, SEASONAL ANALYSIS AND SKIN TONE MATCHING

## 1. DETERMINING SKIN UNDERTONES
Before choosing a palette, one must identify the biological undertone of the skin.

### The Vein Test
- **Cool Undertone:** Veins on the wrist appear blue or purple.
- **Warm Undertone:** Veins on the wrist appear green or olive.
- **Neutral Undertone:** Veins appear colorless or a mix of blue and green.

### The Jewelry Test
- **Cool:** Silver, platinum, and white gold make the skin look healthy and vibrant.
- **Warm:** Gold, bronze, and copper make the skin glow.

### The Reaction to Sun
- **Cool:** Burns easily, turns pink/red, rarely tans well.
- **Warm:** Tans easily, turns golden brown, rarely burns.

## 2. GENERAL SKIN TONE MATCHING RULES
- **Fair/Pale Skin:** Often works well with darker hues for contrast (Navy, Charcoal, Burgundy). Avoid washing out with too many pastels unless they are icy/crisp.
- **Wheat/Medium Skin:** Very versatile. Works well with primary colors, earth tones, and metallics. Be careful with shades that are too close to the exact skin tone (nudes).
- **Dark Skin:** Can pull off high-impact, vivid colors (Cobalt Blue, Bright Red, Yellow) and stark whites. Pastels also look striking against dark skin due to contrast.

## 3. THE 12 SEASONS COLOR ANALYSIS SYSTEM

### WINTER (Cool, Deep, Clear)
- **Characteristics:** High contrast between skin, eyes, and hair. Skin often has blue/pink undertones.
- **Palette:** Jewel tones. Royal blue, emerald green, ruby red, stark black, crisp white, icy pastels.
- **Avoid:** Earth tones, orange, gold, beige, warm browns.

### SUMMER (Cool, Light, Soft)
- **Characteristics:** Low to medium contrast. Ashy hair tones. Skin has cool, pinkish undertones but is softer than Winter.
- **Palette:** Dusty, muted shades. Lavender, powder blue, soft rose, charcoal grey (instead of black), off-white.
- **Avoid:** Bright orange, neon colors, stark black (can be too harsh), mustard yellow.

### AUTUMN (Warm, Deep, Soft)
- **Characteristics:** Golden undertones. Hair often has red, auburn, or golden highlights. Low contrast compared to Winter.
- **Palette:** Earth tones. Olive green, burnt orange, mustard yellow, camel, rich brown, warm cream, teal.
- **Avoid:** Pastels, bright pink, stark white, icy blue.

### SPRING (Warm, Light, Clear)
- **Characteristics:** Clear, warm, and bright. "Fresh" look. Strawberry blonde or golden brown hair.
- **Palette:** Bright and cheerful colors. Coral, peach, turquoise, warm yellow, lime green, ivory.
- **Avoid:** Black (too heavy), dark grey, muted/muddy colors, cool berry tones.

## 4. COLOR COORDINATION FORMULAS

### The Color Wheel Logic
- **Complementary Colors:** Colors directly opposite on the wheel (e.g., Blue and Orange). High contrast, bold look.
- **Analogous Colors:** Colors next to each other (e.g., Blue and Green). Harmonious, calming look.
- **Monochromatic:** Different shades, tints, and tones of a single color. Lengthens the silhouette and looks sophisticated.

### The 60-30-10 Rule
A timeless formula for balancing colors in an outfit:
- **60% Main Color:** The base of the outfit. Usually trousers, coats, or jackets. (e.g., A Navy Suit).
- **30% Secondary Color:** Supports the main color but provides contrast. Usually shirts or tops. (e.g., A White Shirt).
- **10% Accent Color:** The "pop" of color. Accessories, ties, pocket squares, or shoes. (e.g., A Burgundy Tie).
