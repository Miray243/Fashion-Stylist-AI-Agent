# TEXTILE SCIENCE: FABRIC PROPERTIES AND COORDINATION

## 1. FABRIC TYPES AND TECHNICAL CHARACTERISTICS

### Cotton (The Versatile Natural Fiber)
- **Properties:** Natural cellulosic fiber. Highly breathable, absorbs moisture (hydrophilic), and soft against the skin.
- **Usage:** Ideal for summer wear, t-shirts, underwear, and casual shirts. It is hypoallergenic.
- **Care:** Can shrink in hot water. Wrinkles moderately.

### Linen (The Summer Essential)
- **Properties:** Made from the flax plant. It has very high air permeability and heat conductivity, making it feel cool to the touch. Stronger than cotton but less elastic.
- **Usage:** Perfect for hot and humid climates.
- **Styling Note:** Linen wrinkles very easily and naturally. This "lived-in" look is part of its charm in casual settings but makes it less suitable for strict corporate formal wear unless blended with cotton.

### Polyester (The Durable Synthetic)
- **Properties:** Synthetic polymer. Extremely durable, resistant to stretching, shrinking, and wrinkling. It is hydrophobic (does not absorb water easily) but can trap heat/sweat if not engineered properly.
- **Usage:** Often used in blends to add durability to natural fibers. Good for outerwear, sportswear, and budget-friendly suiting.
- **Styling Note:** Can sometimes look shiny or "cheap" if low quality. Matte finishes are preferred for a professional look.

### Wool (The Insulator)
- **Properties:** Animal fiber (sheep, goat, alpaca). Excellent insulator (traps air). It can absorb moisture without feeling wet. It has natural elasticity and drape.
- **Varieties:**
  - *Merino:* Fine, soft, suitable for base layers.
  - *Cashmere:* Extremely soft and warm, luxury fiber.
  - *Tweed/Flannel:* Heavier, textured weaves for jackets.
- **Usage:** Essential for autumn and winter wardrobes.

### Silk (The Luxury Fiber)
- **Properties:** Natural protein fiber. Has a natural sheen (luster) and drapes beautifully. Good thermal regulation (warm in winter, cool in summer).
- **Usage:** Formal blouses, ties, evening gowns, scarves.

## 2. FABRIC AND TEXTURE PAIRING RULES
Mixing textures adds depth to an outfit, especially in monochromatic looks.

### The Weight Balance Rule
- **Heavy with Light:** Contrast the weight of fabrics. Pair chunky heavy knits (Wool) with light, smooth fabrics like silk or satin skirts.
- **Structure with Flow:** Pair a stiff leather jacket or heavy denim (Structure) with a flowy chiffon dress or soft cotton t-shirt (Flow).

### Denim Dynamics
- Denim acts as a "neutral texture." It can be paired with almost anything: velvet, silk, cotton, or wool.
- **Double Denim:** When wearing denim on denim (Canadian Tuxedo), ensure the washes are significantly different (e.g., Light Chambray shirt + Dark Raw Denim jeans).

### Seasonal Appropriateness
- **Summer:** Focus on open weaves. Linen, Cotton Poplin, Seersucker, Rayon.
- **Winter:** Focus on dense weaves and insulation. Wool, Cashmere, Tweed, Corduroy, Velvet, Flannel.
- **Transitional (Spring/Fall):** Medium weights. Merino wool, Denim, Gabardine (Trench coat fabric), Leather.
