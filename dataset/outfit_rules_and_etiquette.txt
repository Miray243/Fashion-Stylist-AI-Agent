# WARDROBE ARCHITECTURE, SCENARIOS, AND DRESS CODES

## 1. THE CAPSULE WARDROBE FORMULA
A functional wardrobe relies on cohesiveness and interchangeability.
- **Base Color:** (Choose 1-2) Navy, Black, Grey, or Beige. This makes up 50% of items (trousers, coats, shoes).
- **Neutral Coordinate:** (Choose 2-3) White, Cream, Chambray, Denim. Makes up 30% (shirts, t-shirts).
- **Accent Color:** (Choose 1-2) Based on Color Theory (e.g., Red, Olive). Makes up 20% (accessories, statement tops).

## 2. PATTERN MIXING RULES
- **The Scale Rule:** Never mix two patterns of the same size. Formula: 1 Large Scale Pattern + 1 Small Scale Pattern. (e.g., Wide Stripe Shirt + Small Polka Dot Tie).
- **The Color Connector:** Both patterns must share at least one dominant color to look cohesive.
- **The Neutral Break:** Use solid neutral pieces (jacket, belt) to break up bold patterns.
